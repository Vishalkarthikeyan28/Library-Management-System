## üê≥ Deploy with Docker

You can quickly set up and run BookLore using Docker.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker & Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

**Image Repositories:**

- Docker Hub: `https://hub.docker.com/r/booklore/booklore`
- GitHub Container Registry: `https://ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore`

> **Note:** Legacy images under `https://ghcr.io/adityachandelgit/booklore-app` will remain available but will not receive new updates.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create docker-compose.yml

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you intend to run the container as a non-root user, you must manually create all of your `/your/local/path/to/booklore` directories with read and write permissions for your intended user **before first run**.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with content:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    # Official Docker Hub image:
    image: booklore/booklore:latest
    # Or the GHCR image:
    # image: ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore:latest
    container_name: booklore
    environment:
      - USER_ID=0
      - GROUP_ID=0
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/booklore
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=booklore                          # Must match MYSQL_USER defined in the mariadb container
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password              
      - BOOKLORE_PORT=6060                                  # Port BookLore listens on inside the container; must match container port below
    depends_on:
      mariadb:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "6060:6060" # HostPort:ContainerPort ‚Üí Keep both numbers the same, and also ensure the container port matches BOOKLORE_PORT, no exceptions. 
      # All three (host port, container port, BOOKLORE_PORT) must be identical for BookLore to function properly.
      # Example: To expose on host port 7070, set BOOKLORE_PORT=7070 and use "7070:7070". 
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data       # Application data (settings, metadata, cache, etc.). Persist this folder to retain your library state across container restarts.
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books:/books         # Primary book library folder. Mount your collection here so BookLore can access and organize your books.
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop   # BookDrop folder. Files placed here are automatically detected and prepared for import.
    restart: unless-stopped

  mariadb:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:11.4.5
    container_name: mariadb
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=super_secure_password  # Use a strong password for the database's root user, should be different from MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=booklore
      - MYSQL_USER=booklore                        # Must match DATABASE_USERNAME defined in the booklore container
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password        # Use a strong password; must match DATABASE_PASSWORD defined in the booklore container
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/mariadb/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "mariadb-admin", "ping", "-h", "localhost" ]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Environment Variables

### BookLore Container

| Key                  | Default Value                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `USER_ID`            | `0`                                    | User ID for file ownership within the container. Set this to match your host user's UID if running as non-root (e.g., `1000`). Use `id -u` on Linux to find your UID.                                                                                              |
| `GROUP_ID`           | `0`                                    | Group ID for file ownership within the container. Set this to match your host user's GID if running as non-root (e.g., `1000`). Use `id -g` on Linux to find your GID.                                                                                             |
| `TZ`                 | `Etc/UTC`                              | Timezone for the application. Controls timestamps in logs and UI. Use standard timezone identifiers (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`). See [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | `jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/booklore` | JDBC connection string for MariaDB/MySQL database. Format: `jdbc:mariadb://hostname:port/database_name`. Only modify if using a custom database host, port, or external database server.                                                                           |
| `DATABASE_USERNAME`  | `booklore`                             | Username for database authentication. Must match `MYSQL_USER` in your MariaDB container configuration.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD`  | -                                      | Password for database authentication. **Required**. Use a strong, unique password. Must match `MYSQL_PASSWORD` in your MariaDB container configuration. Store securely and never commit to version control.                                                        |
| `BOOKLORE_PORT`      | `6060`                                 | Internal port BookLore listens on. **Critical**: This must match both the host and container ports in your port mapping (e.g., `6060:6060`). Changing this requires updating all three values. Example: For port `7070`, use `BOOKLORE_PORT=7070` and `7070:7070`. |
| `SWAGGER_ENABLED`    | `false`                                | Controls access to Swagger UI for API documentation and testing. Set to `true` to enable at `/swagger-ui.html` (useful for development/testing). Keep `false` in production for security.                                                                          |
| `FORCE_DISABLE_OIDC` | `false`                                | Forces local username/password authentication only. Set to `true` to completely disable OIDC/OAuth2 providers (Authentik, Pocket ID, etc.). Useful for troubleshooting authentication issues or temporarily bypassing external identity providers.                 |

### MariaDB Container

| Key                   | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PUID`                | `1000`        | Process User ID for the LinuxServer.io MariaDB container. Set this to match your host user's UID for proper file permissions. Use `id -u` on Linux to find your UID.                                            |
| `PGID`                | `1000`        | Process Group ID for the LinuxServer.io MariaDB container. Set this to match your host user's GID for proper file permissions. Use `id -g` on Linux to find your GID.                                           |
| `TZ`                  | `Etc/UTC`     | Timezone for the MariaDB container. Should match the BookLore container's timezone for consistency in timestamps.                                                                                                |
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | -             | Root password for the MariaDB database. **Required**. Use a strong, unique password different from `MYSQL_PASSWORD`. This provides administrative access to the database server. Never expose or commit to VCS. |
| `MYSQL_DATABASE`      | `booklore`    | Name of the database to create on first run. This database will be used by BookLore to store all application data. Should not be changed after initial setup.                                                   |
| `MYSQL_USER`          | `booklore`    | Username for the application database user. Must match `DATABASE_USERNAME` in the BookLore container configuration. This user will have full access to the `MYSQL_DATABASE`.                                     |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD`      | -             | Password for the application database user. **Required**. Use a strong, unique password. Must match `DATABASE_PASSWORD` in the BookLore container configuration. Store securely and never commit to VCS.         |

## üì• Bookdrop Folder: Auto-Import Files

BookLore now supports a **Bookdrop folder**, a special directory where you can drop your book files (`.pdf`, `.epub`, `.cbz`, etc.), and BookLore will automatically detect, process, and prepare them for import. This makes it easy to bulk add new books without manually uploading each one.

### üîç How It Works

1. **File Watcher:** A background process continuously monitors the Bookdrop folder.
2. **File Detection:** When new files are added, BookLore automatically reads them and extracts basic metadata (title, author, etc.) from filenames or embedded data.
3. **Optional Metadata Fetching:** If enabled, BookLore can query metadata sources like Google Books or Open Library to enrich the book information.
4. **Review & Finalize:** You can then review the detected books in the Bookdrop UI, edit metadata if needed, and assign each book to a library and folder structure before finalizing the import.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Docker Setup)

To enable the Bookdrop feature in Docker:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books:/books
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop # üëà Bookdrop directory
```

## üîë OIDC/OAuth2 Authentication (Authentik, Pocket ID, etc.)

BookLore supports optional OIDC/OAuth2 authentication for secure access. This feature allows you to integrate external authentication providers for a seamless login experience.

While the integration has been tested with **Authentik** and **Pocket ID**, it should work with other OIDC providers like **Authelia** as well. The setup allows you to use either JWT-based local authentication or external providers, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred method.

For detailed instructions on setting up OIDC authentication:

- üì∫ [YouTube video on configuring Authentik with BookLore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Ufh9ldF9M)
- üìò [Step-by-step setup guide for Pocket ID](docs/OIDC-Setup-With-PocketID.md)

## üõ°Ô∏è Forward Auth with Reverse Proxy

BookLore also supports **Forward Auth** (also known as Remote Auth) for authentication through reverse proxies like **Traefik**, **Nginx**, or **Caddy**. Forward Auth works by having your reverse proxy handle authentication and pass user information via HTTP headers to BookLore. This can be set up
with providers like **Authelia** and **Authentik**.
